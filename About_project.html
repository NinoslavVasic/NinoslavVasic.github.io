<p>BACKGROUND</p>

<p>Blockchain is a digital-ledger that is tamper-proof and auditable. The ledger is used as a common source of truth between parties who must transact, but often do not (or cannot) trust each other. Without shared, immutable data, each party is forced to hold proprietary information, creating a fragmented environment that results in redundancy and the need for manual reconciliation across multiple intermediaries. Based on studies conducted at the IBM/Columbia Blockchain Accelerator, a successful blockchain network will, therefore, be the “Switzerland” of an industry. Each network member must see a common problem related to a mission-critical function that the ledger can solve in a neutral manner. The common problems are usually related to process optimization, cost reduction, risk reduction, convenience/usability, and accessibility. In other words, the focus must be on designing a minimum viable ecosystem (MVE) that delivers shared value for an industry and for all members of the network. This doesn’t mean the network operator will not be compensated. According to IBM, $4 trillion in market value will be created by ledger technologies over the next 10 years, with the lion’s share of profits accruing to network operators - like us!</p>

<p>GOALS</p>

<p>Our primary goal is to deliver code for our final project in the form of a dApp. Stretch goals could include a UI or rudimentary front-end and python code to launch and monitor the dApp. Apart from the concrete deliverables, I propose we settle on a project that has a solid use-case, so that if everything works, we can deploy a live version onto the ethereum network. </p>

<p>CATEGORIES</p>

<p>Most of the blockchain applications I’ve seen can be categorized into three areas: (1) provenance such as tracking and tracing a widget or data along a supply chain or life-cycle; (2) tokenization of assets; and (3) digital exchange or marketplace including contribution and attribution frameworks. Here are some specific use cases.</p>

<p>Asset Management: Trade Processing and Settlement*
Insurance: Claims processing
Payments: Cross-Border Payments
Unconventional money lenders/ hard money lending
Blockchain Internet-of-Things (IoT)
Smart Appliances
Supply Chain Sensors
Healthcare
Music
Government
Identity</p>

<p>IDEAS</p>

<p>Below are some nascent concepts. They are at a very early stage, but can provide a framework for us to discuss, vette, and finally decide on which project to select. Please feel free to add and edit. </p>
