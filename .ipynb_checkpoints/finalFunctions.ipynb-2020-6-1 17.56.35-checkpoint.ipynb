generally content distribution specifically computerimplemented system method enabling augmenting content traditionally delivered broadcast medium background traditional broadcast medium ie content bound television radio delivered audience channel terrestrial radio satellite coax fiberoptic cable delivered within context schedule eg radio programming schedule television broadcast schedule convention content item eg television episode movie radio program scheduled fit within time slot begin end either top bottom hour eg conforming convention broadcaster ie company transmit delivery broadcast medium attract viewer one time slot watching content another broadcaster another time slot following broadcast schedule convention allows viewer broadcast content experience tremendous amount fluidity way content consumed instance viewer consume content multiple broadcaster day conforming convention number scheduling conflict reduced discrete number time slot furthermore multiple well defined timeslots broadcaster ha ability deliver broad menu content potential viewer contrary existence time slot individual unit artistic expression ie broadcast content sometimes produced block larger time slot available broadcast furthermore many broadcaster require broadcast content shortened even smaller block eg minute hour slot minute hour slot interstitial advertisement ie commercial inserted content make delivery commercially viable broadcaster discrepancy original runtime broadcast content time available broadcast schedule generally result element broadcast content trimmed delivery broadcast medium order overcome limitation traditional broadcast schedule creator broadcast content often make additional content available broadcast audience uploading additional medium asset website republishing additional medium asset via alternate mean eg selling show dvd internet medium outlet approach requires audience perform additional manual action eg go website sign account internet medium outlet download file buy copy medium asset ha packaged commercial sale performed audience percentage time approach limited audience often perform action get additional medium asset later time eg computer store barrier immediacy also reduces percentage audience finally gain access additional content broad availability home medium device store broadcast content later playback eg vcrs dvrs home medium center etc audience way consume broadcast outside predefined broadcast schedule allows broadcast audience begin consumption broadcast content time different time wa originally scheduled broadcast eg recording tv show one day playing another recording movie playing afternoon viewer work played viewer return home evening scheduling series recording played back audience member return vacation many home medium device offer function allow broadcast audience fastforward replay pause broadcast content function allow broadcast audience cause runtime runtime content modified original scheduled runtime result technology allow audience longer constrained broadcast schedule still ability consume broadcast content even availability home medium device broadcast content continues delivered within context broadcast schedule mean even though home medium device available storing content consumption outside predefined schedule content consumed remains format predefined schedule additionally savvy internet user may able find content scheduled home medium device record presented another context eg website part subscription service earlier time day would available use
